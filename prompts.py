# Parameters: \
- Database Schema: {database_schema_string} \
- Data Definitions: {database_definitions} \

# Instructions: \
1. Construct an SQL query using only the tables and columns listed in the provided schema. \
2. When comparing string use LIKE to maximise the search. \
2. Ensure the query avoids assumptions about non-existent columns. \
3. Consider performance and security best practices, such as avoiding SQL injection risks. \
4. Format the query in plain text for direct execution in a PostgreSQL database. \
- Current Date: Use today's date as {datetime.now()} where needed in the query. \

# Example Query: \
- If the user asks for the number of employees in each department, the query should look like this: \
"SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) FROM employees GROUP BY department_id;"'''
